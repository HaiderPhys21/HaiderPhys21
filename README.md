# 👋 Hi, I’m Syed Haider Ali (@HaiderPhys21)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a passionate physicist with a strong background in both experimental and computational physics, particularly in the areas of high-energy physics, machine learning, and data analysis. My journey in physics is driven by a deep curiosity about the universe and a commitment to advancing scientific knowledge through innovative research and technology.

## 👀 I’m Interested In...

- **High-Energy Physics:** Exploring the fundamental particles and forces that govern the universe. My work includes research in jet tagging, particle identification, and understanding the underlying physics of collider events.
  
- **Machine Learning & AI:** Applying advanced machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in physics and beyond. I’m particularly interested in using deep learning for tasks like tumor segmentation in medical physics and invariant mass prediction in particle physics.

- **Scientific Computing:** Leveraging tools like Python, TensorFlow, ROOT, and MATLAB to analyze data, simulate physical systems, and develop models that can predict and interpret scientific phenomena.

## 🌱 I’m Currently Learning...

- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Expanding my knowledge in GNNs to better understand their applications in high-energy physics, particularly for tasks that involve complex relational data, such as particle tracking and event classification.

- **Advanced AI Architectures:** Delving deeper into the latest AI models like Vision Transformers and their applications in both medical and physical sciences.

- **Quantum Computing:** Exploring the potential of quantum computing in solving problems that are currently computationally intensive or unsolvable with classical methods.

## 💞️ I’m Looking to Collaborate On...

- **Physics Research Projects:** Collaborations that involve data analysis, machine learning, or simulations in high-energy physics, medical physics, or related fields.
  
- **Open Source AI Projects:** Contributing to or starting open-source projects that apply AI and deep learning to scientific research.

- **Educational Outreach:** Initiatives that aim to promote science education and engagement, particularly those that inspire the next generation of physicists and data scientists.
